      fullDescription: `In September of 2023, I started to learn philosophy. It is helping me rewire my brain and help me get out of inappropriate social constructs. On the other hand, psychology makes human lives better and history makes us know where we came from and where we are heading to.
*Here are my true findings:*
1. Philosophers can be wrong; they present to you their thoughts ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2. It's easier to understand people's thoughts when you are a philosopher.
3. Philosophers run the world. 

*My best philosophical concepts:*
1. Solipsism: You and only you exist.
2. Empiricism: The source of human knowledge is experience.
3. Rationalism: Reason and logic are the primary sources of knowledge and truth.
4. Resilience & Stoicism. Ability to endure Destructions

*My best psychological concepts:*
1. Halo effect. Judgment based on looks 
2. Habituation. Disliking repetitive tasks. 

*Psychological concepts I can't entirely agree fully with:*
1. Synchronicity. Coincidences

*Horror history:*
1. Dark ages. A period between 5th-15th century.
